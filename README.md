 TOPIC: Demonstrating the Four Features of OOP in Python
 DATE: 01/11/2025

 PROGRAM TITLE: SIMPLE SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

 This program demonstrates:
 - Encapsulation
 - Abstraction
 - Inheritance
 - Polymorphism
 by allowing users to register students and teachers.


 🎓 Simple School Management System (Python OOP Project)

📄 Description
This project demonstrates the **four major Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using a simple school management system written in **Python**.

The program allows users to register either a **Student** or a **Teacher**, showing how:
- **Abstraction** is implemented through the abstract `Person` class.
- **Inheritance** allows `Student` and `Teacher` to share and extend behaviors.
- **Encapsulation** hides sensitive data like student scores.
- **Polymorphism** lets both subclasses have unique versions of the same method `show_details()`.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
| OOP Feature | Implementation | Description |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Abstraction | `Person(ABC)` | Abstract class for shared structure |
| Inheritance | `Student` & `Teacher` | Both extend from `Person` |
| Encapsulation | `__scores` | Private attribute in `Student` class |
| Polymorphism | `show_details()` | Same method name, different behavior |
